# Portfolio
Keeping html pages up to date is a lot of work. Especially when I only want to focus on the text content rather than the delivery. Here's my portfolio in all its glory.

See the issues section for portfolio items.

If I have it here, I'm happy to talk about it with you. Shoot me an email, PM or InMail.
